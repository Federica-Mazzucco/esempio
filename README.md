Example repository to understand how this shit works

## Instructions
Once the repo is created, you need to get a copy of it on your computer: CLONE it to you pc (basically it's like downloading it). To do this, clone with HTTPS address.
Open command line (Git Bash in my case), and use git clone [HTTPS ADDRESS]. This makes a local copy in the chosen directory (git working dir, penso basti aprire GitBash direttamente da dentro la cartella)
To move in the directory: cd [NAME OF REPOSITORY]
In the local directory you can create files, work on them, etc, all peachy as usual.
To save files and stuff in Git, you need to "commit": open command line from the directory and go through ‘status’ , ‘add’ , ‘commit’ and ‘push’.
Status: check the files you have modified with git status. A list of changes will appear.
Add: with the help of the change list, you can add all files you want to upload with git add [FILENAME] [FILENAME] [...]
Commit: write a message that explains what you did and changed. Example: git commit -m "ho aggiunto il report Moses Illusion in HTML"
Push: this operation puts the work on GitHub by "pushing" it to Remote (kind of a duplicate of our repo that lives on a remote server. To know the remote's name: git remote. Usually the remote is named "origin". All good? Push the work on the remote: git push origin master.
Go to the repo on the GitHub web page (your profile), and the pushed files should be there.
Please let this shit work, I have stuff to do (T_T)

I love :pizza: and :sunflower:
